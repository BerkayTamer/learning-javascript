// This is a comment that the computer will ignore.
// It is for your eyes only!
document.write("cake".length);
console.log("cake".length);

    //The "//" sign is for comments. A comment is a line of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code. It's just for humans to read.

    //Comments make your program easier to understand. When you look back at your code or others want to collaborate with you, they can read your comments and easily figure out what your code does.
